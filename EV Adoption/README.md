# California’s Transition to Electric Vehicles

**California’s Transition to Electric Vehicles** is an interactive, scrolly-telling dashboard built to help **residents**, **policymakers**, and **advocates** understand the evolving landscape of electric vehicle (EV) adoption across the state.

This tool aggregates **county-level data** to visualize the **environmental**, **social**, and **infrastructural** dimensions of the shift to zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs). A special focus is placed on **equity**, offering a lens into the disparities in EV access and charging infrastructure.

## Features

### EV Adoption Trends by County

- Interactive **choropleth map** displaying changes from **2021 to 2024**
- Hover and click to view detailed **county-level statistics**
- Highlights **regional disparities**, especially between **high- and low-income counties**

### EV Infrastructure Accessibility

- Visualizes the **distribution of public chargers** across **Bay Area counties**
- Identifies **infrastructure gaps** that may hinder EV adoption
- Supports understanding of how **access to chargers** correlates with **adoption rates**

### ZEV Equity Index

A composite index designed to measure each county’s relative standing in the ZEV transition, emphasizing **equitable access**.

**Formula:**
ZEV Equity Index = z(Income) + z(Chargers per Capita) + z(Share of Multi-Family Units)


- **Higher scores** reflect better structural support for ZEV adoption
- **Lower scores** indicate systemic barriers and areas needing targeted policy action
- Supports **data-informed prioritization** of equity investments

### Policy Landscape and Recommendations

- Overview of key **federal and state policies** related to ZEVs
- Summarizes:
  - **Incentive programs**
  - **Charger deployment initiatives**
  - **Equity-focused legislation**
- Provides **forward-looking recommendations** to:
  - Close EV adoption gaps
  - Expand charger accessibility
  - Promote a **just transition** to electrification

## Future Improvements

- **Expand** the ZEV Equity Index to include **all California counties**, beyond the Bay Area
- **Refine the index** by incorporating additional variables such as:
  - **Transportation costs**
  - **EV rebate accessibility**
  - **Average commute distances**
- **Integrate** an incentive calculator from a related project to help users estimate available EV rebates
- **Enhance the user interface** for smoother scrolling and visual clarity
- **Link relevant resources** on EV adoption, charging, and financial assistance
- Conduct deeper **policy analysis** to localize and strengthen the recommendations
