    <h2>Project Overview</h2>

    <p>
      The transition to electrified transportation and energy systems is a
      pivotal component of California’s strategy to combat climate change.
      However, the success of this transition depends not only on technological
      advancements but also on data accessibility, financial viability, and
      equitable adoption across diverse communities.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our hypothesis is that by enhancing access to localized data on electric
      vehicle (EV) adoption, residential electrification, and their correlated
      impacts on greenhouse gas emissions, we can empower communities to make
      informed decisions about energy usage and infrastructure investment.
      Through policy analysis and the development of user-friendly dashboards,
      we aim to provide clear, actionable insights that highlight cost savings,
      policy effectiveness, and environmental benefits.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our work is grounded in the understanding that socioeconomic disparities,
      lack of awareness, and policy misalignment have hindered the widespread
      adoption of electrification solutions, and addressing these challenges
      requires a data-driven, community-centric approach.
    </p>

    <h3>Our Focus Areas</h3>

    <p>
      To explore this hypothesis, our project focuses on three interconnected
      themes:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Residential Electrification:</strong>
        We analyze the economic and environmental trade-offs associated with
        switching from natural gas to electric appliances, such as heat pumps
        and induction stoves. Our dashboard simulates how factors like
        electricity rates, home heating efficiency, and local climate conditions
        influence cost savings and emissions reduction.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>EV Adoption:</strong>
        We evaluate the barriers that different communities face in
        transitioning to electric transportation. By leveraging historical data
        on EV sales, charging infrastructure availability, and regional income
        levels, we identify opportunities for increasing adoption.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong></strong>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Our Mission</h3>

    <p>
      This integrated approach is critical for ensuring that California’s
      electrification transition does not deepen existing economic and
      environmental inequalities. While electrification promises long-term cost
      savings and climate benefits, access to these benefits remains unevenly
      distributed.
    </p>

    <p>
      By providing transparent and actionable data, we seek to mitigate
      disparities, inform policy, and support communities in making decisions
      that align with both financial feasibility and sustainability goals. Our
      work ultimately aims to bridge the gap between policy, technology, and
      consumer decision-making, ensuring that the transition to a clean energy
      future is both effective and inclusive.
