    <h2>Project Overview</h2>

    <p>
      The transition to electrified transportation and energy systems is a
      pivotal component of California’s strategy to combat climate change.
      However, the success of this transition depends not only on technological
      advancements but also on data accessibility, financial viability, and
      equitable adoption across diverse communities.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our hypothesis is that by enhancing access to localized data on electric
      vehicle (EV) adoption, residential electrification, and their correlated
      impacts on greenhouse gas emissions, we can empower communities to make
      informed decisions about energy usage and infrastructure investment.
      Through the development of user-friendly dashboards,
      we aim to provide clear, actionable insights that show cost savings, environmental benefits,
      and equitable distribution.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our work is grounded in the understanding that socioeconomic disparities and
      lack of awareness have hindered the widespread
      adoption of electrification solutions and addressing these challenges
      requires a data-driven, community-centered approach.
    </p>

    <h3>Our Focus Areas</h3>

    <p>
      To explore this hypothesis, our project focuses on two interconnected
      themes:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Residential Electrification:</strong>
        We analyze the economic and environmental trade-offs associated with
        switching from natural gas to electric appliances, such as heat pumps
        and induction stoves. Our dashboard simulates how factors like
        electricity rates, home heating efficiency, and local climate conditions
        influence cost savings and emissions reductions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>EV Adoption:</strong>
        We evaluate the barriers that different communities face in
        transitioning to electric transportation. By leveraging historical data
        on EV sales, charging infrastructure availability, and regional income
        levels, we identify opportunities for increasing adoption. We conduct this
        analysis on county-level and zip code-level data.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Our Mission</h3>

    <p>
      Taking an integrated approach is important to ensure that California’s shift to electric vehicles 
      does not reinforce existing economic and environmental inequalities. Although electrification offers 
      long-term savings and climate benefits, access to those benefits is still far from equal.
    </p>

    <p>
      By making data more transparent and actionable, we hope to highlight disparities
      and help communities make decisions that balance cost and sustainability. 
      Ultimately, this work is about closing the gap between technology, implementation, 
      and everyday decision making so the shift to clean energy is effective, equitable, and inclusive.
    </p>
